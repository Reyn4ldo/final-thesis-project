# AMR Dataset Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the datasets used for the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Pattern Recognition project.

## Directory Structure

- **raw/**: Original, unprocessed datasets
  - `rawdata.csv`: Original AMR dataset containing antibiotic resistance test results
  
- **processed/**: Cleaned and preprocessed datasets ready for modeling
  - `cleaned_data.csv`: Dataset after cleaning and encoding (generated by preprocessing notebook)
  - `unsupervised_results.csv`: Results from clustering and dimensionality reduction (optional)

## Data Dictionary

### Raw Data (rawdata.csv)

The raw dataset contains antimicrobial resistance test results with the following general structure:

**Expected Columns** (to be confirmed during exploration):

- **Sample ID**: Unique identifier for each bacterial isolate
- **Organism/Species**: Type of bacteria tested
- **Source/Specimen Type**: Origin of the sample (e.g., blood, urine, wound)
- **Date**: Collection date
- **Antibiotic Columns**: Results for various antibiotics tested
  - Values: R (Resistant), S (Susceptible), I (Intermediate)
  - Common antibiotics may include: Penicillin, Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin, etc.

### Processed Data

After preprocessing, the data should contain:

- **Encoded Features**: 
  - Binary encoding for resistance (1 = Resistant, 0 = Susceptible/Intermediate)
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables (organism, source, etc.)
  - Normalized numerical features

- **Derived Features**:
  - MAR Index: Multiple Antibiotic Resistance index
  - Temporal features (year, month, season)
  - Resistance pattern features

- **Target Variable**: 
  - The prediction target (to be defined based on research question)
  - Examples: MDR classification, specific antibiotic resistance

## Data Quality Notes

- **Missing Values**: Strategy for handling will be determined during preprocessing
- **Class Imbalance**: May require balancing techniques (SMOTE, oversampling, etc.)
- **Outliers**: To be identified and handled during data exploration

## Data Usage

1. **Exploration**: Use `notebooks/00_data_exploration.ipynb` to understand the data
2. **Preprocessing**: Use `notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean and prepare data
3. **Modeling**: Processed data is used in subsequent modeling notebooks

## Data Privacy and Ethics

- Ensure data is anonymized and contains no patient identifiable information
- Follow institutional guidelines for handling healthcare data
- Cite data sources appropriately in the thesis
